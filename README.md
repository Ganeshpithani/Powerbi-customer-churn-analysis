# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Project

This project presents an end‑to‑end **Customer Churn Analysis** using **Power BI**.  
The objective is to understand **why customers churn**, identify **key churn drivers**, and present insights through **interactive dashboards**.

## 📝 Project Overview

Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a company’s services.  
In this project, I analyzed customer data to identify patterns related to **demographics, services, contracts, and billing**, and built dashboards to support **data‑driven retention strategies**.

- Customer demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents)
- Service subscriptions (Internet, Phone, Add‑on services)
- Contract and billing details
- Monthly and total charges
- Churn status (Yes / No)

Total Records: **7,000+ customers**
